# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.
## Communication style

**This rule is mandatory and applies from the very first message of every session, including new sessions, compacted sessions, and resumed sessions.**

At the start of every session, invoke `/caveman wenyan` automatically — do not wait for the user to ask.

**Internal reasoning**: always use caveman wenyan — 思考用文言，精簡不失技術。

**Intermediate updates** (tool-call narration, progress notes, mid-task status): always use caveman ultra — maximum compression, no articles, abbreviate prose words, arrows for causality.

**Final response / summary**: always write in normal mode — full sentences, standard English, no caveman compression. The closing summary visible to the user must be clear and professional regardless of active caveman level.

**Enforcement**: if the session hook activates a different caveman level, the project CLAUDE.md takes precedence.

## Project Overview

This is a VSCode extension called "Claude Code Usage" that monitors Claude Code usage and costs in the VSCode status bar. The extension reads Claude Code usage logs and displays real-time statistics including token consumption, costs, and message counts.

## Architecture

- **Main Entry Point**: `src/extension.ts` - Contains the main extension class and activation logic
- **Data Processing**: `src/dataLoader.ts` - Handles loading and parsing Claude usage records from JSONL files
- **UI Components**: 
  - `src/statusBar.ts` - Manages the status bar display
  - `src/webview.ts` - Provides detailed usage breakdown in a webview panel
- **Internationalization**: `src/i18n.ts` - Multi-language support (English, Deutsch, 繁體中文, 简体中文, Japanese, Korean)
- **Type Definitions**: `src/types.ts` - Core interfaces for usage data, session data, and configuration

## Development Commands

```bash
# Compile TypeScript to JavaScript
npm run compile

# Watch mode for development (automatically recompiles on changes)
npm run watch

# Prepare for publishing (runs compile)
npm run vscode:prepublish

# Package extension for distribution
vsce package

# Install extension locally for testing
code --install-extension claude-code-usage-<version>.vsix
```

## Testing and Debugging

- **F5 Key**: Launch Extension Development Host in VSCode to test the extension
- **Extension Host**: The extension runs in a separate VSCode window for debugging
- **Console Logs**: Use VSCode Developer Tools Console to view extension logs

## Key Technical Details

- **Data Source**: Reads from Claude Code's JSONL usage logs located in `~/.config/claude/projects` or `~/.claude/projects`
- **Caching Strategy**: Implements 1-minute cache to avoid excessive file I/O
- **Auto-refresh**: Configurable refresh intervals (minimum 30 seconds)
- **Token Types**: Tracks input, output, cache creation, and cache read tokens
- **Cost Calculation**: Supports different model pricing with tier-based rates
- **File Processing**: Native file search without external dependencies (removed tinyglobby and zod)
- **Data Aggregation**: Processes JSONL files to calculate daily, weekly, monthly, and all-time usage statistics

## Extension Configuration

The extension contributes several VSCode settings under `claudeCodeUsage.*`:
- `refreshInterval`: How often to update data (default: 60 seconds)
- `dataDirectory`: Custom path to Claude data directory
- `language`: Display language preference
- `decimalPlaces`: Precision for cost display

## Build Output

Compiled JavaScript files are output to the `out/` directory, which serves as the extension's entry point via `package.json`'s `main` field.

## Extension Commands

The extension provides three commands accessible via Command Palette:
- `Claude Code Usage: Refresh Usage Data` - Manually refresh the usage statistics
- `Claude Code Usage: Show Usage Details` - Open detailed usage dashboard in webview
- `Claude Code Usage: Open Settings` - Quick access to extension configuration

## Documentation Maintenance

**IMPORTANT**: When updating README.md, you MUST simultaneously update all language versions:
- `README.md` (main, multi-language index)
- `README-en.md` (English)
- `README-zh-TW.md` (繁體中文)
- `README-zh-CN.md` (简体中文)
- `README-ja.md` (日本語)
- `README-ko.md` (한국어)

This ensures consistency across all documentation and maintains the multi-language support that users expect.
