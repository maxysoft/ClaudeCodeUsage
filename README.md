# Claude Code Usage

[![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/maxysoft/ClaudeCodeUsage?style=flat-square&label=Latest%20Release)](https://github.com/maxysoft/ClaudeCodeUsage/releases/latest)
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg?style=flat-square)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

**Track Claude Code and OpenAI Codex usage locally in VS Code.** See today's
tokens in the status bar, remaining quota, cache usage, project and session
trends, and optional usage advice in one dashboard. Install from the
[VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=growthjack.claude-code-usage)
or [Open VSX](https://open-vsx.org/extension/GrowthJack/claude-code-usage).

The extension reads local provider logs. **Processed** Codex tokens include
input and output; **uncached usage** excludes cached input, and quota is the
**last local observation**, not a live account balance. Claude costs and Codex
API-equivalent prices are estimates, **not bills or subscription charges**.
Provider accounts remain the source of truth for billing. The
[简体中文说明](README-zh-CN.md) covers the same features in detail.

Open the dashboard by clicking either usage indicator in the VS Code status
bar. See [features](#features-at-a-glance), [privacy](#privacy),
[installation](#install), and [contributors](#credits) below.

## Features at a glance

- **Claude Code and Codex, side by side:** provider-specific Today, Last 30 days,
  All time, Sessions, and Projects views; Compare keeps their accounting separate.
- **Know what used tokens:** input, cached input, uncached usage, output, models,
  effort, and month → day → hour drill-down without rereading logs on chart clicks.
- **See quota without confusing it with spend:** Claude's official `/usage`
  utilisation and Codex's last-observed remaining allowance; estimates are labelled.
- **Keep sharing under your control:** preview and export local SVG/Markdown;
  sharing is on by default but can be disabled, and GitHub publication is separate.
- **Local first:** source logs stay provider-owned; optional AI advice requires
  an explicit request preview and separate Send action.

## Screenshots

### v2.3 Claude, Codex and Compare

<details>
<summary>Show five historical dashboard previews (v2.3.1–v2.3.2)</summary>


The five v2.3 images below are reproducible captures of the production dashboard
renderer with synthetic fixtures and VS Code Light+/Dark+ theme variables, not
personal usage or billing evidence. Native VSIX installation is verified separately.

![Claude Today in Simplified Chinese, dark theme](images/v2.3.1/claude-today-zh-CN-dark.png)

*Today and Last 30 days share the configured calendar timezone. CLI usage is
counted only when normal persistent sessions leave usage-bearing local logs;
calls made without session persistence cannot be reconstructed.*

![Codex overview in Simplified Chinese, dark theme](images/v2.3.1/codex-overview-zh-CN-dark.png)

*The corrected Codex overview uses one configured-timezone calendar model for
Today, Last 30 days, months, models, effort, and all-time totals.*

![Codex weekly allowance estimate in English, dark theme](images/v2.3.1/codex-weekly-estimate-en-dark.png)

*Observed quota windows retain reset evidence locally. A valid used fraction can
produce labelled total and unused subscription-durability estimates, including
for the current window. Approximate evidence remains visible with low confidence.
Period details start collapsed; expand them to inspect the numeric evidence.*

![Combined Claude and Codex heatmap in English, light theme](images/v2.3.1/compare-heatmap-en-light.png)

*Compare combines provider daily activity without double-counting Codex cached
input or reasoning. Its preview-first share studio offers an Academic Violet
default, curated/custom colors, deterministic local SVG, and privacy-safe
Markdown. It is enabled by default and can be hidden with the single sharing
workspace setting. Card settings sit below the preview; intensity can use quantile,
logarithmic, or linear scaling. The metric is activity volume, not productivity or billing.*

![Project activity matrix in English, dark theme](images/v2.3.2/project-activity-matrix-en-dark.png)

*Projects now adds a Token-only 30/90-day project × day heatmap and stacked
daily trend for both providers. Exact tooltips, explicit coverage, bounded rows,
and an Other-projects tail keep the view auditable without rereading source logs.*

</details>

### Claude status bar

Codex uses a compact **Today token usage** item and a separate **remaining quota**
item: observed 36% weekly utilisation displays `wk 64%`. The hover card retains
utilisation progress bars, reset times, and wrapped explanations. Local Codex
quota is last-observed evidence, not a live account balance.

![Status bar](images/v2-status-bar-en.png)

*Today's cost · current-session cost · 5-hour and weekly quota utilisation.*

Hover the quota indicator for a breakdown:

![Quota tooltip](images/v2-quota-en.png)

*Real `/usage` data: utilisation percent, plus time left and the wall-clock reset for every window.*
*Every weekly cap your plan meters gets its own row, per-model ones included (Anthropic supplies the name, so the row follows whichever model is capped), plus usage credits when you have them enabled.*

⚙ Settings offers a compact quota-format dropdown: Built-in (default), 5-hour only, Weekly only, or Custom. Only Custom reveals the template field.

### Dashboard

![Dashboard — summary and charts](images/v2-dashboard-en.png)

*Click the status bar to open the full dashboard. Stacked token-composition
chart, hourly breakdown, cache hit rate, cost composition by token type,
plus per-model and per-day tables below.*

### Content tab — where your tokens actually go

![Content tab](images/v2-content-en.png)

*Estimated breakdown of which content consumes tokens — your prompts vs.
tool results (by tool) vs. assistant output / thinking. This is the lever
for optimising your usage. Scoped to the last 30 days
(`advice.promptWindowDays`).*

### AI advice — evidence first, sending optional

v2.3 keeps one readable path from a local observation to its
evidence, recommendation, action, feedback, and guarded result. It is off by
default. Local evidence appears before any model is involved; **Helpful**, **Not
helpful**, and **Applied** stay on this device. Once enough reliable, similar
before/after tasks exist, the card reports the frozen comparison result;
otherwise it says that the evidence is insufficient.

Each recommendation can be snoozed for a bounded period; it leaves the default
summary and returns after expiry or when you choose to show it again.

AI personalisation is a separate choice. Aggregate-only is the default and
prompt samples remain off until separately allowed. The extension prepares the
complete request once and shows its exact JSON, byte count, and SHA-256. Preview
sends nothing; **Send this exact request** is a second explicit action, using the
same canonical bytes and your own configured key/endpoint. Claude Code OAuth
credentials are never used as a generative backend.

A flavour of what it returns (illustrative):

> **Write more complete instructions**
> - Several prompts open with "fix the bug" but don't name the file or the
>   symptom, so the first turn is spent searching. Lead with the file + expected
>   vs. actual behaviour.
>
> **Cut waste where it doesn't cost clarity**
> - ~38% of your tokens are spent above 150k context. `/clear` between unrelated
>   tasks keeps each request cheaper.

### Usage Optimizer

![Usage Optimizer card](images/v2-optimizer-en.png)

Paste a rough, half-formed request; get back one clean, **paste-ready** prompt
(plain text, no Markdown) plus a recommended reasoning effort / thinking / model
shown as chips. Three optional toggles refine it (flag vague references · condense
long pastes · suggest a style direction). Experimental, off by default; **only the
text you paste is included** — never your files or the terminal. It now uses the
same full-request preview and separate explicit Send action as AI advice.

### Sharing workspace (optional)

![v2.4 combined sharing workspace, light theme](images/v2.4.0/compare-sharing-en-light.png)

*Production renderer with synthetic usage and VS Code theme variables, not a
real account or an installed-VSIX capture.*

## What's new in 2.4

<details open>
<summary>Current release · status bar, smooth scrolling, and one sharing workspace</summary>

- **Bounded pricing diagnostics** — unknown-model warnings are deduplicated
  and capped for each Extension Host lifetime, removing the per-record warning
  flood reported in [#122](https://github.com/ClaudeCodeUsage/ClaudeCodeUsage/issues/122).
  Already-expired content-analysis
  files retain their empty contribution rather than disrupting live-tail refreshes.
- **Current model prices** — dedicated Standard/cache rates for Opus 5.5,
  Sonnet 5.5, GPT-6.1 Sol, GPT-6 Sol and GPT-6 Luna. Unknown Codex IDs remain
  unpriced; family fallback estimates are not promoted to exact-price coverage.
- **Defensive refreshes** — malformed model metadata no longer aborts a whole
  index. Unsafe object keys cannot mutate shared prototypes; aggregate buckets
  are copied once per update, worker results have a bounded apply window, and
  manual price refreshes have byte, catalog-size, concurrency and time limits.
- **Less disruptive dashboard updates** — pausing auto-refresh freezes both
  provider pages, not background indexing or the status bar. Manual refresh
  remains available; failures retain verified data and show a compact recovery
  message. Primary-log coverage, hourly backfill and retry waits are separate.
  Unchanged hidden panels and weekly usage aggregates reuse bounded caches.
- **Predictable preview and settings** — AI previews show the actual endpoint,
  protocol and model; incompatible settings fail without redirecting to another
  host. Share Card export writes the accepted SVG and requires a new preview
  after control changes. Ordinary defaults reset preserves the API key, and
  the Codex directory remains editable even when provider detection fails.
- **Large-history refreshes** — unchanged Content attribution reuses its data
  without freezing AI controls. Display settings no longer restart completed cold
  reads, and late index results cannot restore superseded prices.
  Today attribution is cached by calendar day: unchanged minute-spaced polls
  update countdowns without rescanning the full history within the hour. The
  hourly hidden-panel refresh still recomputes Content attribution once.
- **Upgrade safety** — unchanged polls retain accepted sharing previews; changing
  the Claude data directory clears the old source even while updates are paused.
  Existing API keys without an explicit protocol retain the prior Anthropic
  format. If preview reports a mismatch, choose the intended API format and URL
  in Settings, then preview again before sending. Upgrade/default reset never
  silently reroutes that key to the new DeepSeek default; new installs use the
  matching OpenAI-compatible format.
- **Codex status and scrolling** — the default compact Token item shows today's
  processed amount; the separate weekly indicator shows remaining capacity.
  Live panel updates wait briefly for scrolling to pause, with a bounded delay.
- **One preview-first sharing workspace** — a full-width export preview now
  leads the surface, with controls below it and one presentation selector for
  the **Combined activity heatmap**, **Claude Share Card**, and **Claude token
  heatmap**. The combined presentation appears only with real data from both
  providers; both legacy presentations remain Claude-only.
- **Compatibility without duplicate panels** — `exportShareCard`,
  `exportHeatmap`, and `publishHeatmapToGitHub` remain available and open the
  matching presentation instead of bypassing preview. `enableShareCard` remains
  the single visible sharing switch and still defaults to on; the retired
  `showHeatmap` value is retained only for one-release state compatibility and
  bounded clearing.
- **Strict local-artifact boundary and provider truth** — switching, previewing,
  and local SVG/Markdown export use materialized aggregates only and perform no
  network request, GitHub sign-in, or profile/avatar/name lookup. Only the
  separate **Publish to GitHub** action for the Claude heatmap can connect; it
  remains public-repository-only and confirms the exact target and create/
  overwrite action before writing. Combined activity is not billing,
  productivity, capability, or cross-provider equivalence.

Both use synthetic fixtures, not a real account.

## What's new in 2.3

The 2.3 series introduced local Codex tracking, provider-aware comparisons,
request-level token attribution, and shareable activity views. It later added
model/pricing updates, the project activity matrix, and month → day → hour
drill-down. See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for patch-by-patch details.

<details>
<summary>Read the v2.3 changes by area</summary>

### Models, token accounting, and cost semantics

- **Refined throughout the v2.3 line** — GPT-6 Astra and Fable 5.1 model
  metadata, optional AWS Bedrock pricing, a fixed-reference display-currency
  selector, a Token-only 30/90-day project activity matrix, complete
  month/day/hour drill-downs, state-preserving refresh, accessible charts, and
  lower watcher/title-index overhead. Patch-level
  details stay in the changelog and GitHub Releases.
- **Codex Beta, enabled by default** — usage records are discovered only from
  `sessions/**/*.jsonl` and `archived_sessions/**/*.jsonl`; credential,
  database, and unknown files stay excluded. Separately, the extension streams
  exactly `$CODEX_HOME/session_index.jsonl` to map `id` to `thread_name` for
  truthful thread titles. Absolute paths are redacted and titles stay memory-only.
  Usage-record JSONL lines are streamed and temporarily parsed only to extract
  allowlisted usage and structural metadata; prompt, response, command, and
  tool-argument fields are not inspected or used for analysis, and are never
  retained or persisted.
  Disable Codex at any time in **Settings → Providers**.
- **Codex-native metrics** — **processed** = input + output; **uncached usage** =
  uncached input + output; **cached input** is a subset of input; **reasoning**
  is a subset of output. The overview also shows input cache hit rate as cached
  input / input. No Codex billing cost is shown. The first Codex summary card is
  a clearly labelled API-equivalent cost estimate for the selected scope; the
  All-time view also shows the weekly trend using the same pricing basis.
- **Calendar-day Today and cost trends** — Codex Today means the current day in
  your configured timezone and adds exact hourly API-equivalent cost beside a
  separate token-composition view. Daily and monthly primary charts default to
  API-equivalent cost while token composition stays separately visible. Only
  exact known-model prices contribute; unknown models remain unpriced and every
  row keeps pricing coverage visible. The schema-3-compatible hourly sidecar
  keeps sparse buckets for the rolling last 30 days, is checkpointed and
  resumable, evicts day 31, and serves date expansion with zero JSONL reads on
  click. Codex monthly charts and tables list months oldest-first.
- **Request-level token attribution** — valid `last_token_usage` components are
  preferred, while its `total_tokens` remains an active-context measurement,
  not request usage. A full numeric total-plus-last signature suppresses only
  proven replay; missing last snapshots fall back to cumulative lineage
  high-water. Upgrading triggers one automatic reindex, with the indexed
  subtotal still visible throughout the pass.

### Weekly estimates and provider boundaries

- **Weekly allowance-value trend** — Claude and Codex All-time / Compare views
  calculate historical used equivalents directly from local token logs. The
  newest valid official reset observation anchors one sequence of unique,
  non-overlapping weekly periods, and each usage event belongs to exactly one
  period; without a usable observation, usage-only rows fall back to
  Monday-to-Monday UTC calendar weeks. A genuinely different quota series with
  an overlapping, non-aligned future reset is a conflict; same-series observations
  remain one series and may be shown as a low-confidence approximation. It cannot
  create a second current period, and period ranges are shown separately from reset times. Codex usage is
  stored in daily slices: when one crosses an official intraday reset, its tokens
  are still counted once, the affected period is labelled a boundary
  approximation. Codex's account-wide `codex` observations can decorate both
  historical and current buckets. If an observed reset drifts from the seven-day
  grid, the sample is mapped to the display period containing its observation
  time; file-source uncertainty, reset drift, and daily boundary crossings lower
  confidence and are labelled as approximate. File keys are not account
  identities, so eligible local files in one home are included together. A
  current period still uses the latest real observation for a low-confidence
  blended estimate when local quota series overlap. Ambiguous completed periods,
  or periods without a usable observation, remain usage-only rather than
  inventing an account split. Any coherent
  observed window—including the current one—can show total and unused durability
  estimates; attribution or boundary uncertainty lowers confidence instead of
  silently replacing the values with dashes.
  This display rule neither changes the index schema nor triggers a rebuild.
  Current official API rates are applied consistently across history. This is a
  proxy, not a bill or an official subscription price. The panel is enabled by
  default and can be hidden in Settings with `showWeeklyEquivalentValue`.

### Dashboard, indexing, and privacy

- **One dashboard render stack** — switching to Codex keeps the established
  Today / Last 30 days / All time / Sessions / Projects / Content / Settings structure,
  relabelled where Codex semantics differ. The same render functions, HTML
  classes, charts, tables, spacing, and responsive rules are used for both
  providers. Claude and Codex time-series charts stay width-aligned while dense
  content scrolls within its own region; Codex recommendations use indexed
  30-day structural evidence.
- **Truthful names, no invented concepts** — root tasks use the latest real
  thread title after path redaction. Child rows prefer their own real thread
  title; when it is missing, they use the reported nickname and display the
  parent/root title; if those are also missing, they receive a localized neutral
  fallback. Projects use the Git repository name or, outside Git, the directory
  basename. The Codex view does not manufacture Branches or Workflows that
  cannot be measured reliably.
- **Claude / Codex / Compare modes** — keep each provider's meaning intact.
  Compare shows input, output, and cache side by side; it never adds unrelated
  costs or quota windows together.
- **Auditable time and coverage** — rolling 7-day and 30-day totals use exact
  event-day slices in your configured timezone. During an incomplete migration
  or rebuild, every Codex card, table, project, session, recommendation, and
  status value is visibly an **indexed subtotal**; unverified legacy totals are
  excluded. Once a Codex home is detected, its provider tab appears immediately;
  the page shows exact indexed-file, percentage, and byte progress during the
  first build, while Compare waits until both providers have real data. After
  the first atomic checkpoint, the complete subtotal dashboard stays usable
  while indexing continues; progress never replaces its cards or tables. A selected Codex home is account-agnostic,
  so logs left by multiple
  sign-ins in that same home are combined. Local logs expose no reliable account
  identity, so limit cards remain **last-observed** and are never summed.
- **Private, scalable local index** — stores machine-salted pseudonymous keys;
  numeric and structural aggregates; and sanitized project, directory, agent,
  model, effort, role, time, and quality metadata. It never persists raw IDs,
  full paths or repository URLs, thread titles, or conversation bodies. A
  background worker scans large histories with a default 30-second watcher delay
  (Off / 10 / 30 / 60 / 120 / 300 seconds).
  A first-time index or incomplete legacy migration gets one bounded 64 GiB /
  16,384-file-pass streaming ceiling; it does not reserve that amount of memory
  and remains cancellable and resumable. After convergence, background work
  returns to 128 MiB / 64 file passes and the always-visible Refresh action uses
  2 GiB / 512 file passes. Unchanged warm refreshes still read zero usage-record
  JSONL body bytes.
- **Provider-aware controls** — the shared Settings tab shows only common and
  Codex-effective controls when Codex is selected. Codex collection and local
  Codex recommendations can each be disabled.
- **Exact-version release notice** — the upgrade message only describes the
  installed release. It is on by default and can be disabled in Settings.

</details>

## What's new in 2.2

<details>
<summary>Sharing, conversation viewer, and usage analysis</summary>

- **Usage share card** (opt-in, `enableShareCard`) — a themed, configurable
  one-page SVG of your usage: pick a range × scope (overall / project / session)
  × which metrics to show, and a theme (**Claude Classic** / **Cream** /
  **Aurora Dark** / **Auto**). Preview and local export never fetch GitHub
  identity data.
  Self-contained and deterministic; no prompts, paths or ids ever leave your
  machine. Chinese locales use 万/亿 units.
- **Read-only conversation viewer** (Sessions tab, **on by default**) — a "view"
  button re-opens a past session's prompts and Markdown-rendered answers so you
  can jog your memory **without** loading it back into the model's context
  (unlike resume). Thinking and tool traffic sit behind toggles; opens on the
  last rounds.
- **Token heatmap** (opt-in, `showHeatmap`) — a GitHub-style yearly token heatmap
  on the All tab, plus **Export / Publish to your GitHub profile** as a
  self-contained SVG with a one-click Markdown embed.
- **Experimental insights** (opt-in, `showInsights`, Content tab) — labelled
  estimates from your local logs: a **cache-churn bill** ($ spent re-writing
  cache after model switches / idle gaps), **cache warmth by model**, **big
  one-shot turns**, **your active hours**, and **skill ROI** (output tokens
  returned per $).
- **Top-10 costliest messages** (opt-in, `showCostliestMessages`) — ranks single
  turns by cost, splitting a **cache miss** from a long answer, with the
  cache-hit rate and the time since the last turn.
- **Sessions "Active" column** — estimated hands-on time per session (idle gaps
  capped at 1.5 h), far more meaningful than the raw first-to-last span.
- **Cache-hit-rate column** in the All-time (monthly) and This-month (daily)
  tables and their drill-downs, so cache efficiency is visible per row.
- **Live-refresh delay** (`fileWatchSeconds`: Off / 1 / 2 / 5 / 10 / 20 / 30 s)
  replaces the on/off live-watch toggle; it only re-reads your **local** logs.
- **Timezone-aware bucketing** — Today / day / month / hour totals all key off
  your configured IANA zone (full UTC-offset dropdown), so they agree with each
  other and the Anthropic console.
- **"What's new" prompt after upgrades** — a single dismissible nudge the first
  time you run a new major.minor version, so opt-in features stay discoverable.
- **Fixes** — Sonnet 5 reports a 1M context window (#50); 1-hour cache writes are
  priced at 2× base input when the log carries the split (#62); background
  windows refresh on focus instead of going stale (#55); the Timezone setting is
  a validated dropdown so a bad value can't crash the dashboard (#51); German
  (de-DE) and Brazilian Portuguese (pt-BR) are selectable everywhere.

</details>

## What's new in 2.1

<details>
<summary>Sessions, workflow analysis, dashboard settings, and AI advice</summary>


- **Sessions: resume / copy / delete** — each row can copy the session id,
  **resume** it (official Claude Code extension in-tab for this project, or a
  terminal `claude --resume <id>` for other projects), or **delete** it (to the
  trash, with confirm). A **Current project / All** filter defaults to the
  current project.
- **Quota display options** — `quotaFiveHourOnly` (show only the 5h
  window) and `showResetInStatusBar` (append the reset countdown, e.g.
  `5h:50%:2.3h | wk:30%:3.2d`), both in ⚙ Settings.
- **Wider dashboard** — detail page widened to 1600 px, still fluid
  on narrow screens.
- **Workflows tab** — every multi-agent run in one place: dynamic-workflow
  runs (ultracode) *and* ad-hoc sub-agent batches, with per-run cost, agent
  count, models used, **cache hit rate** (the "is my provider workflow-ready"
  diagnostic) and a per-agent drill-down labelled by each agent's task.
- **Usage tracking panel** — the official `/usage` "what's contributing"
  view, but multi-provider and with five scopes (Day / Week / Month /
  session / project): >150k-context share, 8h+-session share,
  subagent-heavy share, workflow share, plus Skills / Subagents / Plugins /
  Models breakdowns. Compact card on the Today tab.
- **Thinking share** per session (Sessions column + Today card) with an
  `/effort` hint when it runs high.
- **Workflow quota guard** — a dismissible banner before you start a run
  the remaining 5-hour window can't finish
  (`claudeCodeUsage.workflowQuotaWarnPercent`).
- **Settings in the dashboard** — a new ⚙ Settings tab manages most options
  in place; VS Code's own Settings keeps the language and provider data
  directories. The advice API key is entered in the dashboard and stored in
  SecretStorage, not Settings Sync. Header buttons
  trimmed to AI advice and ⚙ Settings (both jump to their tab); the
  auto-refresh toggle moved into Settings (a manual ↻ appears when paused).
  If you hide the cost, quota *and* context items, the status bar keeps a small
  icon as a way back into the dashboard.
- **Status-bar metric** (`statusBarMetric`) — keep showing today's cost, or
  switch the first item to today's total **token** count (compact k/M).
- **Model-scoped weekly limit** (`showScopedWeekly`, opt-in) — adds the weekly
  cap actually named by Anthropic, such as `fable 17%`; migrated from the
  original model-specific contribution in PR #38 by
  [@wheelbarrel00](https://github.com/wheelbarrel00).
- **AI advice 2.0** — bring your own key for Anthropic or an OpenAI-compatible
  endpoint (`advice.apiFormat`). The v2.3 line places local evidence and an exact full-
  request preview before the separate Send action. Aggregate-only is the
  default; prompt samples and `advice.userContext` require independent prompt-
  personalisation consent and appear verbatim in the preview. The keyless
  Claude Code subscription backend is not shipped and is unreachable.
- **Usage Optimizer** (experimental, `advice.optimizer.enabled`, default off) —
  a Content-tab card where you paste a rough request and get back one tightened
  prompt as **plain text** (paste-ready, no Markdown) plus a recommended effort
  / thinking / model. Three optional lenses (flag ambiguous references ·
  condense long pastes · suggest a style direction). **Only the text you paste
  is included**, and the full provider request must be previewed and explicitly
  sent.
- **Context-window indicator** (experimental, off by default) — opt in via
  Settings to show the current session's context fill in the status bar. A "~"
  marks a guessed window; set `contextWindowOverride` for proxied/custom models.

</details>

## What's new in 2.0

<details>
<summary>Official Claude quota, new tabs, pricing, and live status bar</summary>


- **Real 5-hour and weekly quota** in the status bar — reads the OAuth session
  from the same Claude profile as the window: explicit `dataDirectory`, then
  the first valid `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, then `~/.claude`. The macOS Keychain is
  used only for the default profile.
  Adapted from upstream [PR #9](https://github.com/ClaudeCodeUsage/ClaudeCodeUsage/pull/9)
  by [@Dobidop](https://github.com/Dobidop).
- **Four new tabs**: Sessions, Projects, Content, Branches — all sortable.
- **Token-composition stacked chart** with Y-axis and reference lines.
- **AI advice command** — now routes to the unified local-evidence surface; a
  missing API key leaves the request unsent instead of opening a separate demo
  or transport path.
- **Multi-vendor pricing**: Opus 4.x, Sonnet 4.x, Haiku 4.5 (verified
  against Anthropic's public pricing); reference rates for proxied setups
  (OpenAI, Gemini, DeepSeek, Kimi, GLM, Qwen) with family-aware fallback.
  `Refresh Token Pricing` pulls live LiteLLM data as runtime overrides.
- **Custom timezone** for date display (`claudeCodeUsage.timezone`).
- **Light-theme tab readability** fixed.
- **Locale-aware numbers and dates** throughout (German `.`, English `,`).
- **Real-time status bar** via `fs.watch` (1.5 s debounce) + idle-aware
  refresh + non-blocking loader (yields every 25 files).

## Install

Download the `.vsix` from the [latest GitHub Release](https://github.com/maxysoft/ClaudeCodeUsage/releases/latest),
then:

`Ctrl+Shift+P` → **Extensions: Install from VSIX...** → pick the downloaded `.vsix`.

---

## Configuration

**Most settings live in the dashboard now.** Open the dashboard (run
**Show Usage Details**, or click the ⚙ in its header) and use the **⚙ Settings**
tab — grouped into General, Status bar, Data & refresh, and AI advice &
Optimizer. Changes apply immediately.

To keep VS Code's own Settings UI uncluttered, only three ordinary settings
stay there. The BYOK advice key is entered in the dashboard's ⚙ Settings tab
and stored in SecretStorage; it does not travel with Settings Sync. Open VS Code
Settings (`Ctrl+,`) and search
for **`Claude Code Usage`**:

| Setting | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `language` | `"auto"` | UI language: `auto` / `en` / `de-DE` / `zh-TW` / `zh-CN` / `ja` / `ko` / `pt-BR` / `id`. |
| `dataDirectory` | `""` | Custom Claude data dir; empty = auto-detect. |
| `codex.dataDirectory` | `""` | Custom Codex home; empty = `CODEX_HOME` or `~/.codex`. |

Everything else — refresh interval, status-bar items, number/date formatting,
project grouping, content analysis, and all the AI advice / Optimizer options —
is in the dashboard's ⚙ Settings tab. Upgrading keeps your existing values: a
one-time migration copies them out of `settings.json` on first launch.

For a custom quota status-bar layout, choose **Custom** in ⚙ Settings. The
template accepts `{5h.pct}`, `{wk.pct}` (or `{7d.pct}`), and
`{model:Fable.pct}`; each window also supports `.label` and `.reset`.
Reset styles include `:decimal`, `:units`, `:clock`, and `:at`, for example
`{5h.pct} | {wk.reset:at}`. Missing windows and their separators are omitted.
The built-in choice leaves the existing quota options unchanged.

---

## How costs are calculated

The status-bar cost is **`Σ (tokens × per-million rate)`** across input,
output, cache-write and cache-read, summed by model.

- **Per-million rates** come from the bundled pricing table, which is
  verified against the public Anthropic pricing page and supplemented
  with reference rates for non-Anthropic models that may appear in
  proxied setups.
- **`Refresh Model Pricing`** (command + button in the dashboard) pulls
  live prices from [LiteLLM's public dataset](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm)
  as runtime overrides.
- **Unknown model snapshots** are priced against the current tier of
  their detected family (Opus / Sonnet / Haiku / GPT / Gemini /
  DeepSeek / Kimi / GLM / Qwen) instead of falling back blindly.

Claude transcript totals are counted by **response identity**, not by JSONL
row. One response can produce both a `thinking` row and a `text` row carrying
the same `messageId`, `requestId`, and complete `usage` vector. The extension
keeps the largest vector for that response once; Claude Code's `stats-cache`
adds the rows. The two totals can therefore differ.

What the status bar does **not** know:
- Your actual Anthropic invoice (discounts, free credits, plan caps).
- Whether your proxy provider charges different rates.
- Anything not recorded in your local `.jsonl` log files.

The **5h / weekly quota indicator** is different — it queries Claude
Code's real `/usage` endpoint via the OAuth session and shows the actual
percentage Anthropic is tracking for your account. That number is
authoritative.

## Privacy

The complete user-facing inventory, retention rules, clearing behavior, and
remote boundaries are in [Local data and privacy](LOCAL-DATA.md) ([简体中文](LOCAL-DATA.zh-CN.md)).

| Data | Stored locally | Remote behavior | Clear path |
|---|---|---|---|
| Claude/Codex source logs | Provider-owned and read-only; never copied wholesale | None by default | Managed by the provider tools, not deleted by this extension |
| Codex derived index | Bounded pseudonymous numeric/structural aggregates | None | Rebuild or clear derived index |
| Quota observations | Bounded anonymous window facts; no raw account ID | Claude quota fetch only when enabled; Codex evidence stays local | Clear by provider/account epoch or all |
| UI/share preferences | Tab/filter state plus optional title/range and GitHub destination strings | Publish only after exact explicit confirmation | Reset UI or sharing preferences independently |
| Advice data/key | Bounded aggregate evidence; key only in SecretStorage | Exact previewed request only after separate Send | Clear advice data and key independently |

- All **Claude** token / cost / session analysis runs locally by reading your
  `~/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl` files.
- Codex usage records are discovered only from `sessions/**/*.jsonl` and
  `archived_sessions/**/*.jsonl` below your Codex home. Separately, the extension
  streams exactly `$CODEX_HOME/session_index.jsonl` for the `id` → `thread_name`
  mapping used by truthful thread titles. Absolute paths in those titles are
  redacted and the titles remain memory-only. Credentials, databases, and unknown
  files are not read. Usage-record JSONL lines are streamed and temporarily
  parsed only for allowlisted metadata; prompt, response, command, and
  tool-argument fields are not inspected or used for analysis and are never
  retained. Deterministic insights make no network request.
- The Codex persistent index stores machine-salted pseudonymous keys, numeric
  and structural aggregates, and sanitized project, directory, agent, model,
  effort, role, time, and quality metadata. It never stores raw IDs, full paths
  or repository URLs, thread titles, or conversation bodies.
- The quota indicator calls **`api.anthropic.com/api/oauth/usage`** using
  Claude Code's existing OAuth token. If that token has expired, the extension
  sends the existing refresh token to **`console.anthropic.com/v1/oauth/token`**
  and writes the refreshed credentials back to the selected Claude credential
  file or macOS Keychain item. See [Local data and privacy](LOCAL-DATA.md).
- **AI advice** and the **Usage Optimizer** are the only features that call a
  model — and only after *you* preview and explicitly send a prepared request.
  Advice defaults to allowlisted aggregates; prompt samples and optional user
  context require separate consent. The Optimizer includes **only the text you
  paste into it** (never your files or terminal). Both use the exact previewed
  bytes, the endpoint in `advice.apiUrl`, and your own `advice.apiKey`.
  **Bring your own key**; no key or generative OAuth credential is shipped.

### Known limits

- A reset absent from an official response or local structured event cannot be
  reconstructed; day-only evidence lowers confidence.
- One Codex home may contain several sign-ins. The current period may therefore
  show a low-confidence blended estimate from the latest real observation;
  ambiguous completed periods remain used-only rather than inventing an account split.
- API-equivalent values depend on current known API prices and visible pricing
  coverage. They are not bills or subscription prices.
- Source-log retention belongs to Claude Code and Codex. Uninstall may leave
  host-managed extension storage behind, so the explicit clear controls are the
  reliable deletion route.

## Troubleshooting

**"No Claude Code Data"**
- Make sure Claude Code is installed and you have used it at least once.
- Check the `dataDirectory` setting; auto-detection looks at
  `~/.claude/projects` and `~/.config/claude/projects`.

**One-shot Claude CLI activity is missing**
- Calls made with `--no-session-persistence` can leave a prompt-history entry
  but no project transcript and no token `usage` fields. The extension does not
  invent token or cost totals from prompt history. Run future audited calls
  without that flag if they should appear; past unpersisted token usage cannot
  be reconstructed locally.

**Quota row shows `5h:--% wk:--%`**
- Claude Code's OAuth token is missing or expired. Log in to the active Claude
  profile once. Credentials follow explicit `dataDirectory`, then the first
  valid `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, then `~/.claude`; the single global macOS Keychain
  item is never substituted for a selected custom profile.

**`Get AI Usage Advice` returns 404**
- Match the API format, address and model. For DeepSeek's OpenAI-compatible
  format use `https://api.deepseek.com/chat/completions`; its explicit Anthropic
  compatibility base is `https://api.deepseek.com/anthropic`
  ([official documentation](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/guides/anthropic_api/)).
  The request preview shows the resolved destination; the extension does not
  silently switch providers or remove a configured proxy prefix.

**`Send this exact request` is unavailable**
- Enable the default-off advice-effectiveness setting, allow aggregate data,
  and configure your own `claudeCodeUsage.advice.apiKey`. Previewing is always
  local; without a key the request remains unsent.

**High CPU or sluggish refresh on a large history (Linux included)**
- V2.2.1 removes the hidden 8-second active polling override and bounds the
  first-timestamp scan. Until you install it, set **Live refresh delay** to
  **Off**, set **Refresh interval** to **300–900 seconds**, and optionally turn
  **Content analysis** off. Turning Dashboard auto-refresh off by itself does
  not stop status-bar parsing.
- If V2.2.1 still runs hot, open **Show Diagnostic Logs** and attach only the
  anonymous `refresh:` lines to issue #70; they contain counts and timings, not
  prompts, paths, session IDs, credentials, or raw log lines.

**Usage history disappears or is missing older months**
- Claude Code automatically deletes conversation logs older than
  `cleanupPeriodDays` (default: **30 days**). Once deleted, those records
  cannot be recovered. To retain more history, add this to your
  `~/.claude/settings.json`:
  ```json
  { "cleanupPeriodDays": 365 }
  ```
  This only affects logs kept from now on; already-deleted logs cannot be
  restored. Thanks to [@nickearnshaw](https://github.com/nickearnshaw) for
  documenting this ([PR #21](https://github.com/ClaudeCodeUsage/ClaudeCodeUsage/pull/21)).

**Token counts are lower than Claude Code's `stats-cache`**
- A single response can be written as separate `thinking` and `text` transcript
  rows with the same `messageId`, `requestId`, and complete `usage` vector. The
  extension counts that response identity once and keeps its largest vector;
  Claude Code's `stats-cache` sums the rows. The extension does not apply a
  multiplier to make these different mechanisms agree.

**Token counts appear lower than the model provider's own dashboard**
- If you use Claude Code with a third-party proxy that routes requests
  through sub-agents or background workflows (e.g. ultracode / dynamic
  workflows), each agent writes its own `.jsonl` log file inside a
  sub-directory. The extension reads all these files, but some proxy
  configurations may not write agent-level records at all. Until native
  workflow attribution is added in a future release, the total shown here
  may be lower than the provider's upstream count. Your actual spend is
  always on your provider's billing page.
